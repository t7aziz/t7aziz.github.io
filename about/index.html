    <h1>About me</h1>
    <p>Hi, I’m Taha. I live in Toronto, Canada, and I studied Mechatronics Engineering at the University of Waterloo from 2019 to June of 2024, with an option in Computing. My journey through engineering has been hands-on and diverse, with roles that span software, machine vision, and sensor testing. I’ve always been drawn to understanding how systems come together and figuring out why they sometimes fall apart, which has kept me curious and constantly learning.

        Lately, I’ve been really interested in 3D printing and its potential to change how things are made. The idea of automating processes and bringing scalable manufacturing to smaller operations fascinates me. If I had stayed in academia, I would have likely pursued graduate work in reliability engineering, digging deeper into system validation and failure analysis, which was my favorite subject to study.

        Outside of engineering, I’m a big reader. I enjoy books that challenge my perspective, like The Stranger by Albert Camus, The Secret History by Donna Tartt, and Notes from Underground by Dostoevsky. Reading gives me a break from the technical side of my work while feeding my curiosity in a different way.

        I’ve always been drawn to environments where I can work alongside people who are just as eager to solve complex problems as I am. I like being part of a team where learning is part of the process, and where experimenting, iterating, and figuring things out is all part of getting to a solution.
